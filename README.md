# R

This is a collection of R code that I have put together over many years, and as such it uses inconsistent styles and often looks quite poorly formatted (don't use tabs in the R GUI, FYI!)  Much of it was me working through text books, so in those cases, the references are cited at the top.  Mostly, this repo just serves as a backup.
